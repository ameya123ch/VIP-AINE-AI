# Project 9: Image Classification using Deep Learning by Ameya Chaudhari

# Problem Statement
The outbreak of COVID-19 has had an immense impact on world health and daily life in many countries. The first imaging procedure that played an important role in COVID-19 treatment was the chest X-ray. Radiological imaging is often used as a method that emphasizes the performance of chest X-rays. Recent findings indicate the presence of COVID-19 infections in the patients with irregular findings on chest X-rays. There are many reports on this topic that include machine learning strategies for the identification of COVID-19 using chest X-rays.
This project uses radiological imaging to determine whether the scanned patient has COVID-19 or not.

Aim: With the Chest X - Ray dataset, develop a Deep Learning Model to classify the X Rays of Healthy vs Corona positive patients.
